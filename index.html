      <p>My name is Nadeem, and i used to be a software engineer. At least, that was what i formally studied
in college.</p>

<p>Now, I just completed my masters degree in computer science from St. Xavier's College. How did i get 
from point A to point B you ask? Read on...</p>

<a id="about-me" class="anchor" href="#about-me" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me</h3>

<p>I was fortunate enough to know from a young age that i wanted to be an engineer;the engineering 
way of thinking came naturally to me. What i don't know was the type of engineer I wanted to be. 
When push came to shove, I choose Software engineering because it was most committal.</p>

<p>Truth be told, what I really enjoy, and what i really want to be, is learn. When i graduated from 
*<strong><em>Xavier's</em></strong>* and now seeking for a Software Developer job.</p>
